Build a full-stack web application called "TarmacIQ" — an AI-powered 
Ground Operations Intelligence Platform for airline turnaround management.

TECH STACK:
- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- Charts: Recharts or Chart.js
- Color Theme: Deep navy (#0a0f1e) background, electric blue (#00aaff) 
  accents, amber (#f59e0b) for warnings, red (#ef4444) for critical alerts. 
  Clean white text. Premium dark dashboard aesthetic.

THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES:
IndiGround Services manages 8 gates at a regional hub. Ground ops teams 
(fuel, baggage, catering) work in silos causing Turnaround Time (TAT) bloat. 
Every minute of delay = ₹5,400 in penalties. TarmacIQ predicts TAT, detects 
bottlenecks, and quantifies financial risk before the flight even lands.

PAGE 1 — LIVE OPS DASHBOARD (main page)

Header:
- TarmacIQ logo (airplane icon) on top left
- Current date/time (live clock) top right
- Subtitle: "Ground Operations Intelligence Platform"

Section 1 — Gate Map (8 gates displayed as cards in a 4x2 grid):
Each gate card shows:
  - Gate number (G1 to G8)
  - Flight ID (e.g. 6E-204)
  - Airline name
  - Status badge: ACTIVE (blue) / CLEARING (amber) / FREE (green)
  - Predicted TAT (e.g. "47 min")
  - Bottleneck flag: which resource needs immediate action
    → BAGGAGE 🧳 (red badge) / FUEL ⛽ (amber badge) / CATERING 🍽️ (blue badge)
  - Penalty risk: ₹ amount in red if delay predicted
  - A mini horizontal progress bar showing time elapsed vs predicted TAT

Section 2 — Incoming Flight Panel (right sidebar or below gate map):
Table of next 5 incoming flights showing:
  - Flight ID, Airline, ETA, Aircraft Type, Predicted TAT, Risk Level

Section 3 — Penalty Summary Bar (top of page, full width):
  - Total predicted penalty across all active gates (₹ amount, large font)
  - Color coded: green < ₹50K, amber ₹50K–₹2L, red > ₹2L

PAGE 2 — FLIGHT ANALYSIS (click any flight or gate to open)

Left Panel — Flight Details:
  - Flight ID, Airline, Aircraft Type
  - Arrival Time, Predicted TAT, Target TAT (35 min narrow / 60 min wide body)
  - Arrival Delay input field (user can adjust and re-run prediction)

Center Panel — Sub-Process Breakdown:
  Horizontal stacked bar chart showing:
  - Baggage Duration (% of TAT) — color coded
  - Fuel Duration (% of TAT)
  - Catering Duration (% of TAT)
  - Safety Check (% of TAT)
  With a bold label: "BOTTLENECK: BAGGAGE — Expedite to save ₹91,800"

Right Panel — Monte Carlo Results:
  - Bell curve / histogram chart of 1000 simulated TAT outcomes
  - Three vertical lines marking P50, P75, P90
  - Table below:
    | Scenario | TAT | Penalty |
    | P50 (Expected) | 47 min | ₹32,400 |
    | P75 (Moderate Risk) | 54 min | ₹67,500 |
    | P90 (Worst Case) | 63 min | ₹1,21,500 |
  - Bottleneck consistency: "Baggage is bottleneck in 73% of simulations"

PAGE 3 — HISTORICAL ANALYTICS

- Line chart: Average TAT per day over past 30 days
- Bar chart: Bottleneck frequency (Baggage vs Fuel vs Catering — which caused 
  most delays historically)
- Heatmap: Gate utilization by hour of day (8 gates × 24 hours)
- KPI cards: Avg TAT, Total Penalties This Month, Most Delayed Airline, 
  Peak Delay Hour

PAGE 4 — PREDICTION INPUT (manual flight entry)

Form with fields:
  - Flight ID (text)
  - Airline (dropdown: IndiGo, Air India, SpiceJet, GoFirst, Vistara)
  - Aircraft Type (auto-filled from airline: Narrow/Wide body)
  - Arrival Time (datetime picker)
  - Arrival Delay in minutes (number input)
  - Fuel Liters (number)
  - Bags Count (number)
  - Priority Bags (number)
  - Meals Qty (number)
  - Special Meals (number)
  - Catering Required (toggle)
  - Safety Check (toggle)

On clicking "PREDICT TAT" button:
  - Show animated loading spinner
  - Display: Predicted TAT, Bottleneck Resource, Penalty Risk
  - Show which gate it will be assigned to (next free gate from G1-G8)
  - Trigger Monte Carlo and show P50/P75/P90 results

BACKEND (Python Flask):

Create these API endpoints:

POST /predict
  - Input: flight features
  - Run linear regression model (train on synthetic data if no CSV provided)
  - Calculate Baggage_Duration, Fuel_Duration, Catering_Duration
  - Identify bottleneck = max(Baggage_Share, Fuel_Share, Catering_Share)
  - Return: predicted_TAT, bottleneck, penalty_risk

POST /montecarlo
  - Input: flight features + predicted sub-process durations
  - Run 1000 simulations with numpy random normal noise
  - Return: P50, P75, P90 TAT values and penalty amounts, 
    bottleneck_consistency percentage, histogram data array

GET /gates
  - Return current state of all 8 gates (free/active/clearing, 
    flight assigned, TAT progress)

GET /analytics
  - Return historical summary stats for Page 3 charts

SYNTHETIC DATA:
Since no real CSV is provided, generate 500 synthetic flight records 
on backend startup with realistic values:
  - Airlines: IndiGo (40%), Air India (15%), SpiceJet (25%), 
    Vistara (10%), GoFirst (10%)
  - Narrow body TAT: Normal(35, 8) minutes
  - Wide body TAT: Normal(60, 12) minutes
  - Fuel_Liters: 2000-8000 for narrow, 8000-20000 for wide
  - Bags_Count: 80-180 for narrow, 200-350 for wide
  - Catering_Required: 70% of flights
  - Add realistic correlations (higher bags = longer baggage duration)

---

UI REQUIREMENTS:
- Fully responsive (works on tablet and desktop)
- Smooth page transitions
- Animated number counters for KPI cards (count up effect)
- Pulsing red dot on gates with critical delay risk
- Auto-refresh gate map every 30 seconds
- Tooltip on hover for every chart element
- Premium glassmorphism card style (semi-transparent cards with blur)
- Font: Inter or Space Grotesk
